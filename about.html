      <h1>About the Project</h1>
      <p>
        The State Capacity Project is dedicated to understanding and strengthening how governments deliver. 
        Around the world, the ability of public institutions to provide essential services is uneven. 
        In some contexts it is taken for granted, in others it is fragile or absent, and everywhere it is contested. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Too often, state capacity is discussed in abstract terms, disconnected from the realities of execution. 
        This project takes a different approach. We study the mechanics of delivery with attention to both 
        what works and where capacity breaks down. We examine how competent execution happens, what conditions 
        enable or undermine it, and how delivery can be sustained or rebuilt when systems fail. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Our work is aimed at policymakers, practitioners, funders, and the public. 
        Through research and case studies, we seek to make competence visible and to provide frameworks 
        that support institutions in building stronger, more reliable forms of delivery.
