      <h1>About the Project</h1>
      <p>
        At a moment when confidence in government is fragile, the State Capacity Project sets out to study how competence is built, sustained, and lost. Our focus is not on policy aspirations but on the operational realities that determine whether institutions can deliver what they promise.
      </p>
      <p>
        By examining where systems break down and where they succeed, we seek to make state capacity visible and comprehensible to a wider audience. Through research, events, and case studies, we produce frameworks that allow policymakers, practitioners, and funders to better understand what effective delivery requires and how it can be maintained.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our work examines the mechanics of public service delivery across different contexts: transit systems, permit processing, benefit administration, infrastructure maintenance. We document both competent execution and the conditions that enable or destroy it, making visible the gap between how delivery is discussed and how it operates on the ground.
