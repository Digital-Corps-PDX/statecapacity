      <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Across the world, the ability of governments to deliver essential services is uneven and contested. In some places, state capacity is robust. In others, it's fragile or entirely absent. Everywhere, it's under pressure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet conversations about state capacity often remain abstract, disconnected from the operational realities that determine whether institutions can execute what they promise. At a moment when confidence in government is fragile and anti-government rhetoric dominates public discourse, we need better ways to see how competent delivery actually happens.

      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <p>
        The State Capacity Project examines how public institutions succeed or fail in delivering the systems that shape daily life. We focus on the mechanics of execution: transit operations, permit processing, benefit administration, and infrastructure maintenance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through research and case studies, we document what enables competent delivery and what causes it to break down. We produce accessible frameworks that help policymakers, practitioners, and funders understand what effective execution requires and how it can be sustained.

      <h2>What's Coming</h2>
      <p>
        In 2026, we'll launch public events examining state capacity in practice and publish case studies documenting delivery successes and failures. More announcements coming soon.
