      <h2>Our Focus</h2>
      <p>
        The State Capacity Project examines how public institutions succeed or fail in delivering the systems that shape daily life. 
        Too often, state capacity is treated as an abstract idea rather than a practical question of execution. 
        We document the mechanics of delivery, paying attention to both what works and where capacity breaks down.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through research and analysis, we aim to make competence visible, to show how execution happens, 
        and to provide frameworks that help policymakers, practitioners, and funders engage with state capacity more directly.
